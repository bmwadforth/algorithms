# Data structures & algorithms

This repository seeks to provide some examples of common data structures in algorithms.

## [Arrays](./arrays)
- Use when direct access to elements by index is required.
- Ideal for small-sized collections with a known fixed size.
- Good for sequential data access or when memory locality matters.

## [Linked Lists](./linked_lists)
- Useful when frequent insertions and deletions are expected.
- Dynamic size and efficient insertion/removal at the beginning or middle.
- Not suitable for random access due to traversal for element access.

## [Binary Trees](./binary_trees)
- Efficient for hierarchical data representation.
- Useful for search operations, especially in balanced trees.
- Ideal for ordered data storage and retrieval (BST).

## [Hash Maps]('./hash_maps)
- Efficient for key-value pairs with fast retrieval by keys.
- Use when searching, inserting, and deleting key-value pairs are common.
- Ideal for scenarios requiring fast lookup based on a unique identifier.

## [Queues](./queues)
- Use in scenarios requiring FIFO (First-In-First-Out) behavior.
- Ideal for implementing breadth-first search, task scheduling, etc.
- When order preservation is necessary, or managing asynchronous tasks.

## [Graphs](./graphs)
- Perfect for modeling relationships between entities.
- Use for representing networks, social connections, or mapping routes.
- Crucial in graph algorithms like Dijkstra's, BFS, DFS, etc.
